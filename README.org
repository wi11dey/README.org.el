* About
Keep your documentation with your code: readme-org.el generates a completely-customizable Org document from the *Commentary* section of your Elisp code. As an example, the file you're reading right now was generated with readme-org.

Org is a powerful plain-text . Both [[https://github.com][Github]] and [[https://gitlab.com][GitLab]] automatically render and preview README.org files when viewing projects.

The full power of Org can be used in comments, 

(see [[Global Mode]])
